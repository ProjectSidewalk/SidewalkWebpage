                In this HIT, you will <i>virtually</i> walk through city streets in Washington DC to find and label
                accessibility features (<i>e.g.,</i> curb ramps) and problems (<i>e.g.,</i>  degraded sidewalks,
                missing curb ramps) using our custom tool called Project Sidewalk (see adjacent image).

                The HIT will consist of completing simple game-like mission where you are routed along an assigned 1,000
                feet street segment. Once you find and label all accessibility features and problems in this segment,
                the Submit HIT button will appear allowing you to submit your work. <br/> <b>Note</b>: The first time you
                accept a HIT in this group, you will have to complete a brief tutorial before the actual task.
            </p>

                remote crowd workers can find and label accessibility problems using online map imagery.
