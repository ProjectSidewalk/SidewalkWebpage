                        A surface problem is a problem that would cause a bumpy or otherwise uncomfortable experience
                        for someone using a wheelchair or other assistive devices. If something on a surface would make
                        it hard or impossible to cross, it should be labeled as a <i>Surface Problem</i>.

                                You should use a <i>Surface Problem</i> label if a long stretch of sidewalk is less than
                                3ft wide (<a href="https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/2010ADAStandards/2010ADAstandards.htm#Surfaces">ADA 403.5</a>).
                                There should be a label at the beginning and end of a stretch of narrow sidewalk.
                                If the narrow sidewalk stretches multiple streets, label at the beginning and end of each street,
                                with only one label needed at a corner.
                            </p>

                                If the stretch of narrow sidewalk is very short, do not use a <i>Surface Problem</i> label.
                                This often occurs to get around trees. The only time where you should label this is if the narrow
                                section is very narrow (less than 2.75ft wide) (<a href="https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/2010ADAStandards/2010ADAstandards.htm#Surfaces">ADA 403.5.1</a>).

                                You should label avoidable surface problems. In the picture below, you can mark a lower
                                severity rating, around a 2, since the problem is directly on the pedestrian route but is
                                also avoidable. If the problem were not on the pedestrian route, the severity would be ~1.

                                Even though problems in a crosswalk are not part of the sidewalk, they are part of the route
                                that pedestrians are meant to follow, so you should label problems on a crosswalk in the same
                                manner as other surface problems. The example below is severity 2 because it could still be avoided
                                while remaining in the wide crosswalk.
