                    <h2>Curb Ramps</h2>
                    <p>
                        A curb ramp is a short ramp that cuts through or builds up to a curb. An accessible
                        curb ramp is one that provides an accessible route for people with mobility impairments to safely
                        transition from a curbed sidewalk to a roadway, or vice versa
                        (<a href="https://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap6toolkit.htm">ADA</a>).
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="question" id="corners-with-only-one-curb-ramp">How should I label corners with only one curb ramp?</h3>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-sm-12">

                            <p>
                                If a corner has only one curb ramp and it is clearly facing just one side
                                of the street (see left image below), then you should place both a curb ramp label and a missing
                                curb ramp label on the appropriate sides of the corner. For example, in the left image below,
                                you should place a <i>Missing Curb Ramp</i> label at the arrow because there is a crosswalk without a
                                curb ramp and the existing curb ramp at this corner faces the other direction. You should rate
                                this <i>Missing Curb Ramp</i> label as a severity ~3 (rather than, say a 5) because the pedestrian could
                                use the curb ramp that does exist on the corner. However, it would moderately lead them into
                                traffic due to its orientation.

                            <p>
                                If one curb ramp is clearly meant for crossing both streets, as seen in the right image below,
                                you should <strong>not</strong> place a <i>Missing Curb Ramp</i> label, but the severity of the curb
                                is likely >1, depending on how much it would lead someone into traffic.

                                If a curb ramp has surface problems, you should increase its severity
                                rating, but you should <b>not</b> place a <i>Surface Problem</i>
                                label. Sidewalk cracks and such in a curb ramp are one of the many
                                factors that can make a curb ramp less passable, which should result in a higher curb
                                ramp severity rating.

                                In general, this should not result in severity >3 if the debris is the only issue. Debris could cause

                                If a curb ramp has overly steep angled sides (called flares), severity should be between
                                1 and 3 if its flares are the only issue. Steep flares are particularly problematic when
                                there is insufficient landing space at the top of the ramp, since wheelchair users may need to use the
                                flares to make turns and could lose their balance. However, steep flares are not
                                an issue when pedestrians are not meant to be using them anyway.

                                If a curb ramp has a steep counter slope (the slope opposite to the end of a ramp), then
                                its severity rating should be >1 (the ADA requires counter slopes to be at no more than a ~3 degree
                                angle - <a href="https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/2010ADAStandards/2010ADAstandards.htm#curbramps">ADA 406.2</a>).
                                You should only consider obvious cases of steep counter slopes, as we have no angle measurement tools.
