                                If a corner has only one curb ramp and it is clearly facing just one side
                                of the street (see left image below), then you should place both a curb ramp label and a missing
                                curb ramp label on the appropriate sides of the corner. For example, in the left image below,
                                you should place a <i>Missing Curb Ramp</i> label at the arrow because there is a crosswalk without a
                                curb ramp and the existing curb ramp at this corner faces the other direction. You should rate
                                this <i>Missing Curb Ramp</i> label as a severity ~3 (rather than, say a 5) because the pedestrian could
                                use the curb ramp that does exist on the corner. However, it would moderately lead them into
                                traffic due to its orientation.

                                If one curb ramp is clearly meant for crossing both streets, as seen in the right image below,
                                you should <strong>not</strong> place a <i>Missing Curb Ramp</i> label, but the severity of the curb
                                is likely >1, depending on how much it would lead someone into traffic.

                                If a curb ramp has surface problems, you should increase its severity
                                rating, but you should <b>not</b> place a <i>Surface Problem</i>

                                only place <i>Surface Problem</i> labels on the sidewalk, not on curb ramps.

                                If a curb ramp has overly steep angled sides (called flares), severity should be between
                                1 and 3 if its flares are the only issue. Steep flares are particularly problematic when
                                there is insufficient landing space at the top of the ramp, since wheelchair users may need to use the
                                flares to make turns and could lose their balance. However, steep flares are not
                                an issue when pedestrians are not meant to be using them anyway.
