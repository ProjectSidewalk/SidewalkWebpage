                Your labels are used to develop new accessibility-friendly mapping tools (e.g., route planners, map visualizations), to train machine learning algorithms to semi-automatically assess cities in the future,
                and to create better transparency about city accessibility.
                Even five minutes of your day could help make someone elseâ€™s.
