                    This page simply shows you how long our system has logged you working on Project Sidewalk. Crunching
                    the numbers can take a while, so please be patient if the page take a long time to load!

                    If you see a large discrepancy between the time below and how long you estimate that you've worked
                    on the website, you can email volunteer.sidewalk@@gmail.com to try and sort out the issue. The most
                    common reason is that you forgot to log in while working. Try to include as much info you can about
                    when you worked on Project Sidewalk and which pages you were using on the website at those times.
