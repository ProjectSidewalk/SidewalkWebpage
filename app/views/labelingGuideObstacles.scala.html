                                You should place labels at the base of the obstacle, which is any object that blocks a path. Placing a
                                label any higher may make the lat-lng estimation inaccurate. Notice how the label on the lower left image
                                that is not placed at the base of the tree has a lat-lng that is very far from the
                                sidewalk (as seen in the mini map).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If there is a long stretch of construction, like in the example on the right below, you should place
                                a temporary obstacle label at the beginning and end of the construction (in the same manner as in the
                                <a href='@routes.ApplicationController.labelingGuideSurfaceProblems'>Surface Problems</a> section.

                                Severity should be higher for obstacles that cover more of the path, have less room for navigating
                                around them, or would cause pedestrians that avoid them to put themselves into harmâ€™s way (by going
                                into traffic, going off the sidewalk, etc). There are more examples throughout this page.

                                Even though obstacles in a crosswalk are not part of the sidewalk, they are part of the
                                route that pedestrians are meant to follow, so you should label obstacles on a crosswalk
                                in the same manner as other obstacles.
