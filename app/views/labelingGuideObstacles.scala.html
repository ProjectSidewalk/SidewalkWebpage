                    <h2 id="obstacles">Obstacles</h2>
                    <p>
                        Obstacles are objects that are directly on the path of a pedestrian route, thus
                        blocking the path. The ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) requires a "clear floor
                        or ground space" along accessible pedestrian routes (<a href="https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/2010ADAStandards/2010ADAstandards.htm#pgfId-1006198">ADA 305</a>).
                        This allows pedestrians, especially those using walkers or wheelchairs, to remain safely
                        on the sidewalk or crosswalk. Moving off the path to avoid an obstacle may be impossible
                        or may cause imbalance, tripping, or other hazards.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class=question id="how-should-I-mark-an-obstacle">How should I mark an obstacle?</h3>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-sm-12">
                            <p>
                                You should place labels at the base of the obstacle, which is any object that blocks a path. Placing a
                                label any higher may make the lat-lng estimation inaccurate. Notice how the label on the lower left image
                                that is not placed at the base of the tree has a lat-lng that is very far from the
                                sidewalk (as seen in the mini map).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If there is a long stretch of construction, like in the example on the right below, you should place
                                a temporary obstacle label at the beginning and end of the construction (in the same manner as in the
                                <a href='@routes.ApplicationController.labelingGuideSurfaceProblems'>Surface Problems</a> section.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Severity should be higher for obstacles that cover more of the path, have less room for navigating
                                around them, or would cause pedestrians that avoid them to put themselves into harmâ€™s way (by going
                                into traffic, going off the sidewalk, etc). There are more examples throughout this page.

                                You should use an <i>Obstacle</i> label on any permanent fixture that is placed in the direct path of pedestrian routes.
