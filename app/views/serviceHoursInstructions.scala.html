                        The Project Sidewalk website keeps track of how long you've spent working on the site. This
                        makes it easier for you to submit your hours and for us to verify those hours. When signed in,
                        you can always check your time at our
                        <a href="@routes.ApplicationController.timeCheck()">Time Check page</a> or revisit this page by
                        clicking your username in the top right corner of the page!

                        When you're ready to work, click on the "Start Exploring" button above and work for one hour.

                    <li>
                        After that hour, email volunteer.sidewalk@@gmail.com, and include your username and the email
                        address that you used to sign up for Project Sidewalk. Your Project Sidewalk supervisor, Mikey,
                        will respond within a couple of days, giving you feedback on your work and advice on how to
                        improve. It is incredibly important to us that high quality data is being contributed to Project
                        Sidewalk, so this step is very important! <em>Requests to approve hours will most likely be rejected
                        if we have not received an email from you.</em>

                    <li>
                        After receiving feedback from us, you can then work on Project Sidewalk for another hour. After
                        that hour, respond to the email you received to let us know that you're ready for another round
                        of feedback.

                    <li>
                        Once we are confident that you have received enough training to provide high quality data, we
                        will let you know that you are free to work for as many more hours as you need to fulfill your
                        community service requirements!

                        When submitting your hours, please list Mikey Saugstad as your supervisor. And include that same
