            Explanation: https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk/SidewalkWebpage/pull/398#issuecomment-259284249
            Pasted:
            The heading of the panorama indicates the angle in which the user is looking at and could be any number
            between 0 and 360.
            We constantly track the heading to detect when the whole scene has been viewed.
            The problem is that the user might alter between moving clockwise and counter-clockwise
            (this is what was not considered in the original code and caused this problem to happen).
            To detect this, I store and constantly update two variables: viewedCWTransformed and viewedCCWTransformed.
            The first one stores the size of the largest arc from the initial heading that the user has seen while
            moving clockwise.
            Similarly, the second variable stores the same thing but when the user is moving counter-clockwise.
            The sum of these two arcs indicates the portion of the scene that the user has viewed.
            To implement this there are two technical problems:
                (1) the initial heading might be any number in [0, 360] and this would cause a lot of special cases.
                (2) the events are given in discrete time points and therefore it is not very easy to detect if the
                user just moved 10° in clockwise or 350° counter-clockwise.
            To fix the first problem I transfer all the angles in function _transformAngle and then simply assume
            the initial heading is always 0.
            And to fix the second problem I define a variable EPS and use it to detect the direction.


            var direction;
            var EPS = 30; //the smaller it is the higher the speed of calling this function should be
            if (transformedCurrent > 360 - EPS && lastHeadingTransformed < EPS) //interval cross from after 0 to before 360 [30, -30]
                direction = transformedCurrent - (lastHeadingTransformed + 360);
            else if (currentHeadingAngle < EPS && lastHeadingTransformed > 360 - EPS) //interval crossing from before 360 to 0 [-30, 30]
                direction = transformedCurrent - (lastHeadingTransformed - 360);
            else
                direction = transformedCurrent - lastHeadingTransformed; //regular subtraction to determine direction of rotation
            if (direction > 0 ) { //&& transformedCurrent < viewedCWTransformed + EPS
                // user is rotating clockwise
                //viewedCWTransformed = Math.max(viewedCWTransformed, transformedCurrent);
            } else if (direction < 0 ) { //&& transformedCurrent > viewedCCWTransformed - EPS
                //user is rotating counter clockwise
                //viewedCCWTransformed = Math.min(viewedCCWTransformed, transformedCurrent);
            }
            lastHeadingTransformed = transformedCurrent;
            var overallAngleViewed = (360 - viewedCCWTransformed) + viewedCWTransformed;*/
