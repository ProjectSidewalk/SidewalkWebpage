labeling.guide.curb.ramp.summary = A curb ramp is a short ramp that cuts through or builds up to a curb. An accessible curb ramp is one that provides an accessible route for people with mobility impairments to safely transition from a curbed sidewalk to a roadway, or vice versa
labeling.guide.obstacle.summary = Obstacles are objects that are directly on the path of a pedestrian route, thus blocking the path. The ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) requires a "clear floor or ground space" along accessible pedestrian routes. This allows pedestrians, especially those using walkers or wheelchairs, to remain safely on the sidewalk or crosswalk. Moving off the path to avoid an obstacle may be impossible or may cause imbalance, tripping, or other hazards.
labeling.guide.surface.problem.summary = A surface problem is a problem that would cause a bumpy or otherwise uncomfortable experience for someone using a wheelchair or other assistive devices. If something on a surface would make it hard or impossible to cross, it should be labeled as a Surface Problem. For surface problems that cover a large area, you should place a Surface Problem label at the start of the problem, and then continue placing labels every few feet (about 1 per panorama) until the end of the problem.
labeling.guide.no.sidewalk.summary = You should place a No Sidewalk label starting where the sidewalk ends, and then continue placing labels every few feet (about 1 per panorama) until you reach a place where the sidewalk begins again.
labeling.guide.occlusion.summary = Sometimes the view of the sidewalk is completely blocked. In these cases, you should place a "Can''t See the Sidewalk" label. This should rarely be used, so only place the "Can''t See the Sidewalk" label when a sidewalk, ramp, or other accessibility problem cannot be viewed from any angle due to obstructions, such as cars.
