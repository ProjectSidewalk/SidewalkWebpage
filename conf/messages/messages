# OSM way type descriptions. Modified from: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway#Roads
way.type.motorway = The highest-grade highways in a road network, designed for high-speed, long-distance travel. These roads have controlled access with grade-separated interchanges (no at-grade crossings), multiple lanes in each direction, and are normally divided with a median. In many countries, they have specific legal designations and restrictions on certain vehicle classes.
way.type.trunk = Important roads that form a strategic part of a road network, connecting major population centers. While typically high-capacity roads with high traffic volume, they may not have all the motorway features such as full grade separation or access control. Quality can vary significantly by region while maintaining the same classification based on network importance.
way.type.primary = Major highways forming a key part of a regional road network, connecting larger towns and cities. In urban areas, these often function as arterial roads with significant traffic volume. In less developed areas, road surface quality may vary considerably, as the classification is based on the road''s importance in the network hierarchy rather than its physical characteristics.
way.type.secondary = Roads connecting smaller towns and villages, or significant districts within larger urban areas. These roads form an important part of the regional network but have less importance than primary roads. They typically carry moderate traffic volumes and connect to the primary road network.
way.type.tertiary = Roads connecting smaller settlements (villages, hamlets) to each other or linking local neighborhoods to the wider road network. Within urban areas, they often function as collector roads, moving traffic from residential areas to more major routes. They serve a vital role in the network hierarchy despite carrying lower traffic volumes.
way.type.unclassified = The lowest classification in the interconnecting road network, typically serving local traffic needs. Despite the confusing name, these ARE classified roads (not '''roads that couldn''t be classified''). They''re often narrower rural roads connecting farms and small communities, or urban roads of local importance that aren''t primarily residential in nature.
way.type.residential = Roads that primarily provide access to residential properties and housing developments. These are generally low-speed with traffic calming measures, designed for local access rather than through traffic. In urban areas, they typically form the bulk of the street network within neighborhoods.
way.type.service = Small access roads like driveways, parking lots, alleys, etc. We only include such roads in Project Sidewalk if they are listed as an alley.
way.type.living.street = Residential streets where pedestrians have legal priority over cars, speeds are kept very low.
way.type.motorway.link = Connecting roads (slip roads, ramps, etc.) that provide access to or from motorways, or between two motorways. These typically inherit the same access restrictions as the motorways they connect to and are designed for smooth transitions between high-speed roads and other parts of the network.
way.type.trunk.link = Connecting roads that provide access to or from trunk roads. These are transition roads that allow traffic to safely enter or exit the trunk road network, often with design characteristics intermediate between trunk roads and connecting roads.
way.type.primary.link = Connecting roads that provide access to or from primary roads. These are transition segments designed to move traffic between primary roads and roads of the same or lower classification.
way.type.secondary.link = Connecting roads that provide access to or from secondary roads. These transition segments facilitate traffic flow between the secondary road network and other roads.
way.type.tertiary.link = Connecting roads that provide access to or from tertiary roads. These are less common than other link types but serve the same purpose of connecting roads of different classifications to the tertiary network.
way.type.footway = Paths primarily or exclusively for pedestrian use. These include sidewalks (when mapped separately from roads), walking paths through parks, urban walkways, and similar pedestrian infrastructure. May sometimes allow limited usage by other non-motorized users depending on local regulations.
way.type.cycleway = Paths designated primarily or exclusively for bicycle traffic. Includes dedicated cycle tracks separate from roads, bicycle lanes, and shared paths specifically designed for cycling. Physical characteristics and regulations vary by region, but all are primarily intended to serve bicycle traffic.
way.type.pedestrian = Areas or roads primarily or exclusively for pedestrian use, typically with motor vehicle access heavily restricted or prohibited. Commonly used for pedestrianized streets, plazas, or malls in commercial districts where pedestrian traffic dominates.
way.type.steps = A path consisting of one or more flights of steps to facilitate pedestrian movement, often in areas with steep gradients. Not navigable by wheeled vehicles and generally requiring explicit tagging of step count or incline for accessibility routing.
