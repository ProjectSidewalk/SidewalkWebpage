		The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache community of open-source software projects.
    The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus based development process, an open and
    pragmatic software license, and a desire to create high quality software that leads the way in its field.
    We consider ourselves not simply a group of projects sharing a server, but rather a community of developers
    and users.
