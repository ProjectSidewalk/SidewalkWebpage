Welcome to Project Sidewalk! Project Sidewalk is an open source project aimed at mapping and assessing every sidewalk in the world using remote crowdsourcing, artificial intelligence, and online satellite & streetscape imagery.

## Want Project Sidewalk in Your City?
Want a Project Sidewalk server set up for your city/municipality? Read our ["Considerations for Deploying Project Sidewalk into a New City" wiki](https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk/SidewalkWebpage/wiki/Considerations-when-Preparing-for-and-Deploying-to-New-Cities) and then email us at sidewalk@cs.uw.edu!

## Development Environment Instructions
Project Sidewalk's frontend is built on JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. The backend is built on Scala and the Play framework.

Instructions for setting up a development environment for Project Sidewalk can be found [on our wiki](https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk/SidewalkWebpage/wiki/Dev-Environment-Setup). 

These instructions are geared towards internal team members. If you're outside the team and hoping to set up your own server with data for a city that we don't currently support, then you'll want to start with our [Creating a new database wiki page](https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk/SidewalkWebpage/wiki/Creating-database-for-a-new-city). Note that setting up a db for your city is a non-trivial amount of work the first time through, especially for those without experience with GIS software. Feel free to email our lead engineer, Mikey (saugstad@cs.washington.edu) with questions.
