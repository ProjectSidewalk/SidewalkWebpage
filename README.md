Welcome to Project Sidewalk! Project Sidewalk is an open source project aimed at mapping and assessing every sidewalk in the world using remote crowdsourcing, artificial intelligence, and online satellite & streetscape imagery.

## Want Project Sidewalk in Your City?
Want a Project Sidewalk server set up for your city/municipality? You can read about things we consider when choosing new deployment cities on our [wiki](https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk/SidewalkWebpage/wiki/Considerations-when-Preparing-for-and-Deploying-to-New-Cities), including geographic diversity, presence of local advocates, funding, etc. You can also read some past discussions [here](https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk/SidewalkWebpage/issues/1379), [here](https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk/SidewalkWebpage/issues/1626), and [here](https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk/SidewalkWebpage/issues/281). 

If you would like to suggest that we deploy in your city/municipality, please read through the links above and then email us at sidewalk@cs.uw.edu!

## Development Environment Instructions

Instructions for setting up a development environment for Project Sidewalk can be found [on our wiki](https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk/SidewalkWebpage/wiki/Dev-Environment-Setup). 

These instructions are geared towards internal team members. If you're outside the team and hoping to set up your own server with data for a city that we don't currently support, then you'll want to start with our [Creating a new database wiki page](https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk/SidewalkWebpage/wiki/Creating-database-for-a-new-city). Note that setting up a db for your city is a non-trivial amount of work the first time through, especially for those without experience with GIS software. Feel free to email our lead engineer, Mikey (saugstad@cs.washington.edu) with questions.
